```

#### **After (GPT-4o Mini)**
```
Analysis: "The alert with Rule ID 1000001 flags a suspicious HTTP request 
originating from internal IP 192.168.1.100 targeting admin login page with 
SQL injection payload 'UNION SELECT * FROM users--'. This represents a 
classic SQL injection attack attempting to bypass authentication and 
extract sensitive user data from the database..."

Confidence: 0.95
Recommendations: "Immediate actions should include: 1) Block source IP, 
2) Audit web application for SQL injection vulnerabilities, 3) Review 
database logs for unauthorized access..."

Cost: $0.0003 per analysis
```
